Add what was just learned or fixed to the **project-level** CLAUDE.md Learnings section (the CLAUDE.md in the current working directory or the nearest parent git repo root — never ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md or any global config). If no project CLAUDE.md exists, create one in the repo root. Format as a bullet point with a bold title and brief explanation. Only add genuinely useful information that would help future sessions.
