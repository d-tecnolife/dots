Re-scan the system and update ~/ENVIRONMENT.md with current information. Gather hardware, OS, desktop, shell, key packages, display, and Hyprland config details by running the appropriate system commands. Preserve the existing file structure and sections but update all values to reflect the current state. If new tools or notable config paths are discovered, add them. Remove anything no longer present.
